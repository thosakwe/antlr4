/// This class implements a vector of bits that grows as needed. Each
/// component of the bit set has a `bool` value. The
/// bits of a `BitSet` are indexed by non-negative ints.
/// Individual indexed bits can be examined, set, or cleared. One
/// `BitSet` may be used to modify the contents of another
/// `BitSet` through logical AND, logical inclusive OR, and
/// logical exclusive OR operations.
///
/// By default, all bits in the set initially have the value `false`.
///
/// Every bit set has a current size, which is the number of bits
/// of space currently in use by the bit set. Note that the size is
/// related to the implementation of a bit set, so it may change with
/// implementation. The length of a bit set relates to logical length
/// of a bit set and is defined independently of implementation.
///
/// Unless otherwise noted, passing a null parameter to any of the
/// methods in a `BitSet` will result in a [NullThrownError].
