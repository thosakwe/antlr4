  // Compute the error recovery set for the current rule.  During

  // enclosing rule. See LinearApproximator.FIRST().
  // This local follow set only includes tokens
  // from within the rule; i.e., the FIRST computation done by
  // antlr4dart stops at the end of a rule.
  //
  //  EXAMPLE
  //
  //  When you find a "no viable alt exception", the input is not
  //  consistent with any of the alternatives for rule r.  The best
  //  thing to do is to consume tokens until you see something that
  //  can legally follow a call to r *or* any rule that called r.
  //  You don't want the exact set of viable next tokens because the
  //  input might just be missing a token--you might consume the
  //  rest of the input looking for one of the missing tokens.
  //
  //  Consider grammar:
  //
  //  a : '[' b ']'
  //    | '(' b ')'
  //    ;
  //  b : c '^' INT ;
  //  c : ID
  //    | INT
  //    ;
  //
  //  At each rule invocation, the set of tokens that could follow
  //  that rule is pushed on a stack.  Here are the various
  //  context-sensitive follow sets:
  //
  //  FOLLOW(b1_in_a) = FIRST(']') = ']'
  //  FOLLOW(b2_in_a) = FIRST(')') = ')'
  //  FOLLOW(c_in_b) = FIRST('^') = '^'
  //
  //  Upon erroneous input "[]", the call chain is
  //
  //  a -> b -> c
  //
  //  and, hence, the follow context stack is:
  //
  //  depth     follow set       start of rule execution
  //    0         <EOF>                    a (from main())
  //    1          ']'                     b
  //    2          '^'                     c
  //
  //  Notice that ')' is not included, because b would have to have
  //  been called from a different context in rule a for ')' to be
  //  included.
  //
  //  For error recovery, we cannot consider FOLLOW(c)
  //  (context-sensitive or otherwise).  We need the combined set of
  //  all context-sensitive FOLLOW sets--the set of all tokens that
  //  could follow any reference in the call chain.  We need to
  //  resync to one of those tokens.  Note that FOLLOW(c)='^' and if
  //  we resync'd to that token, we'd consume until EOF.  We need to
  //  sync to context-sensitive FOLLOWs for a, b, and c: {']','^'}.
  //  In this case, for input "[]", LA(1) is ']' and in the set, so we would
  //  not consume anything. After printing an error, rule c would
  //  return normally.  Rule b would not find the required '^' though.
  //  At this point, it gets a mismatched token error and throws an
  //  exception (since LA(1) is not in the viable following token
  //  set).  The rule exception handler tries to recover, but finds
  //  the same recovery set and doesn't consume anything.  Rule b
  //  exits normally returning to rule a.  Now it finds the ']' (and
  //  with the successful match exits errorRecovery mode).
  //
  //  So, you can see that the parser walks up the call chain looking
  //  for the token that was a member of the recovery set.
  //
  //  Errors are not generated in errorRecovery mode.
  //
  //  antlr4dart's error recovery mechanism is based upon original ideas:

  //
  //  Like Grosch I implement context-sensitive FOLLOW sets that are combined
